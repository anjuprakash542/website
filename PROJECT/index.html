<div> <p> As a "pure" container, " the div tag " in html element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on.</p></div>
<!-- WITHOUT DIV TAG ALSO THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH WILL APPEAR WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN THE WEBSITE -->

<span> <p> The "span tag" is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The "span tag" is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The "span tag" is much like the "div" element, but "div" is a block-level element and "span" is an inline element.
Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.
